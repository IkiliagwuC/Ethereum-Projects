# Overview
ERC1155 has emerged as a gold standard to create NFTs; every major marketplace lists new tokens as an ERC1155 standard. In this project, I used the ERC1155 token standard to create an ERC1155 token.

Goals:
- Create 3 NFT collections
- Create and deploy an ERC-1155 contract
- Update the contract to be compatible with OpenSea
- Deploy an NFT collection
